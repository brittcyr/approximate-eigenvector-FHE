Approximate Eigenvector FHE
===========

Approximate Eigenvector FHE

This is a project for 6.892 to implement the GSW Approximate Eigenvector scheme for fully homomorphic encryption. The ciphertexts are in Ctxt.cpp and the crypto operations are in FHE.cpp

To run it, change the makefile to load your installation of NTL and then an example is in main. The parameters that can be changed are the error distribution, the size of the matrices and the size of the modulus. The error size is in the Ctxt.cpp and the others are in main.
